      <a href="/20131020-backbone/">Difficult to Believe but Optimized</a>
      <span class="date">Oct 20</span>
    </h3>

    <p>Day 1 of studying backbonejs, and I found this gem in the source:</p>
<pre>
// A difficult-to-believe, but optimized internal dispatch function for
// triggering events. Tries to keep the usual cases speedy (most internal
// Backbone events have 3 arguments).
var triggerEvents = function(events, args) {
  var ev, i = -1, l = events.length, a1 = args[0], a2 = args[1], a3 = args[2];

  switch (args.length) {
    case 0: while (++i < l) (ev = events[i]).callback.call(ev.ctx); return;
    case 1: while (++i < l) (ev = events[i]).callback.call(ev.ctx, a1); return;
    case 2: while (++i < l) (ev = events[i]).callback.call(ev.ctx, a1, a2); return;
    case 3: while (++i < l) (ev = events[i]).callback.call(ev.ctx, a1, a2, a3); return;
    default: while (++i < l) (ev = events[i]).callback.apply(ev.ctx, args);
  }
};
</pre>

<p><code>(ev = events[i])</code> is a nifty trick to save a few characters (and make the code more clear).</p>
<p>Why does this function exist at all?</p>
<p>Looking carefully, it seems that the function attempts to use <code>call</code> rather than <code>apply</code>, only using <code>apply</code> as a last resort.</p>
<p>I think it's because <code>call</code> is faster than <code>apply</code>?</p>

<p>Cool stuff, shows just how much real-world Javascript performance is a dark art.</p>

      <a href="/20131017-jung/">Carl Jung&#39;s Red Book</a>
      <span class="date">Oct 15</span>
    </h3>

    <p><img alt="Jung's Red Book" src="/static/images/20131015jungredbook.jpg" /></p>
<p>I keep running into Jung: in Joseph Campbell's books, <em>The Magic Mountain</em>, and in Rockefeller's biography <em>Titan</em>. I didn't think much at first, but the more I learn, the more bizarre his life and work turns out to be.</p>
<p>The Red Book is one of his manuscripts, 205 pages long, filled with illustrations of his 'inner images':</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The years... when I pursued the inner images, were the most important time of my life. Everything else is to be derived from this. It began at that time, and the later details hardly matter anymore. My entire life consisted in elaborating what had burst forth from the unconscious and flooded me like an enigmatic stream and threatened to break me. That was the stuff and material for more than only one life. Everything later was merely the outer classification, scientific elaboration, and the integration into life. But the numinous beginning, which contained everything, was then.</p>

  <p>
    It's a reminder. The tiniest detail can make a huge difference. Society is the sum of contributions of many people. Small is beautiful.
