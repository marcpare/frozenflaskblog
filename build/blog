<p>A <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/main.html">bunch of documentation</a> from the Apollo space mission, "arguable the most difficult technological undertaking in all of history."</p>
<p>I am amazed how little documentation the engineers that sent a man to the moon produced. They didn't have the possibility of copy+paste, so they had to choose their words carefully and prepare information-rich diagrams.</p>
<p>You can take this reasoning pretty far: Edward Tufte argues convincingly that the advent of <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001yB">Powerpoint <em>reduced</em> the quality of engineering work</a> at Nasa.</p>

      <a href="/20131029-yak/">Backbone Fundamentals Library Example without the Yaks</a>
      <span class="date">Oct 29</span>
    </h3>

    <p>A few more days into my BackboneJS study, and I have been working through a bit of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Developing-Backbone-js-Applications-Addy-Osmani/dp/1449328253">Backbone Fundamentals book</a>. You can read it online for free on <a href="https://github.com/addyosmani/backbone-fundamentals">the author's Github</a>.</p>
<p>I did find myself stuck doing some yak shaving. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>yak shaving is what you are doing when you're doing some stupid, fiddly little task that bears no obvious relationship to what you're supposed to be working on, but yet a chain of twelve causal relations links what you're doing to the original meta-task. <a href="http://projects.csail.mit.edu/gsb/old-archive/gsb-archive/gsb2000-02-11.html">(source)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case, the yak was Mongodb, and shaving it involved debugging its broken installer on my recently updated Macbook. After a half hour of this, I gave up and ported the API in the exercise to use a tiny file-based data store called <a href="https://github.com/jtsage/nodejs-microdb">MicroDB</a>.</p>
<p>MicroDB was less than 200 lines of code, doesn't seem to have been updated in a year, and did exactly as much as I needed it to. It took about 10 minutes to port the code. </p>
<p>I uploaded the ported code to my Github accounts. There may be some sharp edges, but it implements all the major features (add, edit, delete) <a href="https://github.com/marcpare/backbone-fundamental-library-feweryaks">Github</a></p>
<p>I am quite curious now how you would go about building a NodeJS app with a file-based data store. This is a fantastically useful pattern for prototyping or smaller sites. I couldn't find any simple, convenient ways to do this. I'll be on the lookout. </p>

<p>The blue feathers in most birds don't actually have any blue pigment. The particular pattern of pores in the feather's structure scatter certain wavelengths of light so that it appears that they are colored.</p>
<p>In other words, it's a physical (structural) effect, not a chemical one. There isn't actually any blue in a kingfisher's feather.</p>
<p>The man that instigated the scientific investigation of this topic was ornithologist,
Louis Agassiz Fuertes. His bird observations are famous:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He made thousands of bird paintings and sketches, based on studies in nature and details from fresh specimens, that illustrate a range of ornithological works.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the sketches above show, he could draw complex bird behavior from memory.</p>
<p>Awesome to consider how sharply Agassiz managed to hone his skills of observation.</p>

    <p><img alt="TodoMVC logo" src="/static/images/20131026-todomvc.png" /></p>
<p>I learned a style tip about prototypal inheritance a few days ago from my study of BackboneJS, and I got to encounter the friendly folks behind TodoMVC.</p>
<p>I noticed a parameter that wasn't strictly necessary to the behavior of a function.</p>
<p>Here are the functions:</p>
<pre>
filterOne: function(todo){ todo.trigger('visible'); }
filterAll: function(){ app.todos.each(this.filterOne, this); }
</pre>

<p>Here is the change you can make to <code>filterAll</code> without breaking the behavior:</p>
<pre>
filterAll: function(){ app.todos.each(this.filterOne); }
</pre>

<p>I received a reply to my filed issue in less than a few hours. <a href="https://twitter.com/passy">@passy</a> let me know that, while not strictly necessary, passing in the extra <code>this</code> helps by keeping the current object around in case the <code>filterOne</code> function needs it in the future. </p>
<p>This sort of situation is not one that I have encountered in object-oriented programming, where you can't reassign the context of a function. In Javascript, this is really easy and, as I found out, something you encounter right away.</p>
<p>Do check out <a href="https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc">TodoMVC</a> if you're poking around modern Javascript frameworks. There is nothing like looking at real implementations. They responded to my issue filing right away, and I've learned a lot from their code so far.</p>

<p>Norman Ernest Borlaug was an American agronomist, humanitarian and Nobel laureate who has been called "The Man Who Saved A Billion Lives". (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug">wiki</a>)</p>
<p>How did Dr. Borlaug go about his work? He wasn't the typical stodgy scientist or reclusive nerd:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I needed to be a scrambling quarterback, to dart and weave and grab each chance that showed up in front of me. I couldn't know in advance what would appear, let alone how I'd respond.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He takes this idea further, connecting it to the role that he believes the scientist should play in societyâ€“</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The scientist is a privileged person, the man who should lead us out of the wilderness of static, unproductive agriculture, and yet by this apathy and failure to exercise his unique vision, he keeps us in the swamp of despair.</p>
<p><em>The scientist fears change because he is in a relatively privileged position in his own society.</em> If there is no breakthrough in yield, he will not be criticized. But if he makes a recommendation and something goes wrong, he may lose his job.</p>

<p>The most important new change for me is battery life. Sounds boring, right?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And yet we all find big increases in battery life attractive, sometimes even revelatory, once we experience them. New MacBook Air owners have been giddily posting pictures of their battery status menu and explaining how it has changed their habits and, in some tiny way, their lives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For me, better battery life means better communication. </p>
<p>I may have a design meeting in the morning, coffee in the afternoon, then a work session in the evening. Inevitably, a chance meeting will happen in between.</p>
<p>Conversations tend to take place in places where it's hard to find a power source. Even if it isn't, searching for an adapter and tethering yourself to it reduces the spontaneity and smoothness of the encounter. If you don't have a reliable day's battery life, you'll be estimating constantly if it's worth taking out your computer for a demo.</p>
<p>How much of the success and failure of a software project is determined by the communication between client and developer? </p>
<p>I've found even just small improvements in communication have dramatic impacts on the joy and success of software projects. So, for me, better battery life translates to joy and success.</p>

(from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_Dor%C3%A9">Wikipedia</a>)</p>
<p>Gustave DorÃ© was the most popular illustrator of the the 1800s. He was extraordinarily prolific and commercially successful.</p>
<p>He fits the pattern of superhuman inborn talent finding just the right environment to flourish.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gustave DorÃ© was born in Strasbourg in January 1832. He was the ultimate child prodigy. His earliest dated drawings were from the age of five...By the age of 12 he was carving his own lithographic stones, making sets of engravings with stories to go with them. </p>
<p>DorÃ© exploded onto the Parisian art scene at the age of 15, even though he was short and looked about ten years old. The DorÃ© family visited Paris for the first time when Gustave was 15...One day they went by a publishing company, with a set of engravings displayed in the window. Gustave immediately hatched a plan. </p>
<p>The next morning he feigned illness and told the family to go on without him. He quickly made several sketches and headed for that publishing company. He walked in the front door, found the office of the publisher Charles Philipon, and barged right in. He plopped his drawings down on Philipon's desk and exclaimed, "This is how that set of illustrations should be done." Philipon was amused at Gustave's antics, but when he looked down at the drawings he almost cried.</p>

      <a href="/20131020-backbone/">Difficult to Believe but Optimized</a>
      <span class="date">Oct 20</span>
    </h3>

    <p>Day 1 of studying backbonejs, and I found this gem in the source:</p>
<pre>
// A difficult-to-believe, but optimized internal dispatch function for
// triggering events. Tries to keep the usual cases speedy (most internal
// Backbone events have 3 arguments).
var triggerEvents = function(events, args) {
  var ev, i = -1, l = events.length, a1 = args[0], a2 = args[1], a3 = args[2];

  switch (args.length) {
    case 0: while (++i < l) (ev = events[i]).callback.call(ev.ctx); return;
    case 1: while (++i < l) (ev = events[i]).callback.call(ev.ctx, a1); return;
    case 2: while (++i < l) (ev = events[i]).callback.call(ev.ctx, a1, a2); return;
    case 3: while (++i < l) (ev = events[i]).callback.call(ev.ctx, a1, a2, a3); return;
    default: while (++i < l) (ev = events[i]).callback.apply(ev.ctx, args);
  }
};
</pre>

<p><code>(ev = events[i])</code> is a nifty trick to save a few characters (and make the code more clear).</p>
<p>Why does this function exist at all?</p>
<p>Looking carefully, it seems that the function attempts to use <code>call</code> rather than <code>apply</code>, only using <code>apply</code> as a last resort.</p>
<p>I think it's because <code>call</code> is faster than <code>apply</code>?</p>

<p>I keep running into Jung: in Joseph Campbell's books, <em>The Magic Mountain</em>, and in Rockefeller's biography <em>Titan</em>. I didn't think much at first, but the more I learn, the more bizarre his life and work turns out to be.</p>
<p>The Red Book is one of his manuscripts, 205 pages long, filled with illustrations of his 'inner images':</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The years... when I pursued the inner images, were the most important time of my life. Everything else is to be derived from this. It began at that time, and the later details hardly matter anymore. My entire life consisted in elaborating what had burst forth from the unconscious and flooded me like an enigmatic stream and threatened to break me. That was the stuff and material for more than only one life. Everything later was merely the outer classification, scientific elaboration, and the integration into life. But the numinous beginning, which contained everything, was then.</p>
