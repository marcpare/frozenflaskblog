      <a href="/posts/20140104-flower/">Flowers and Recursion</a>
      <span class="date">Jan 04</span>
    </h3>

    <p>Worms, trees, branches, roots, seeds, genetic algorithms, viruses. Why do we borrow so many metaphors in computing from nature?</p>
<p>These interesting white clusters grow around our place on Vashon Island. They’re called Queen Anne's Lace. They range in size from 1 cm across to about 10 cm. The smaller ones have just a half dozen little buds of flowers. The largest ones are a dense disk of flowers within flowers. I was trying to sort out the pattern of the petals while waiting for the bus one afternoon.</p>
<p>If you look closely, you see that the whole thing is made up of really tiny flowers. These tiny flowers form clumps, which are arranged in growing rings from the center of flower. I tried to count how many flowers were in each clump, but it wasn't all that easy to tell.</p>
<p>Eventually, I decided there were five clumps in each ring. But there were actually two rings at each level, so it's more like there are ten clumps in each ring. I decided that each clump follows the same rules as the overall pattern. Each time a ring emanates one step further from the center of the flower, each clump grows another ring. I used this algorithm to generate a picture of the flower.</p>
<p><img alt="The pattern" src="/static/images/20140104-flowerfractal1.png" />
<img alt="The result" src="/static/images/20140104-flowerfractal2.png" /></p>
<p>It's a recursive algorithm: the pattern of each small cluster of flowers is the same pattern as the arrangement of all the clusters. There's all sorts of clever patterns in the plants, animals, and weather around which keep things from falling apart in the face of astonishing complexity. An intuition about these sorts of patterns will help you write better software since writing software is essentially the act of managing complexity. </p>
<p>So, looking at nature might be good for your programming practice. But this exercise was interesting in sort of the other direction as well: analyzing the algorithm for generating the flower taught me something about nature. It’s satisfying to see that there is some pattern to how the flower is organized. It’s more fun later when you look at another flower and realize a subtle difference in the pattern. This process transforms nature from “that green stuff all around” into an unending collection of delightful things: a specific herb that you can crush up and use to stop bleeding, a marker of the health of the air and soil, a little toy you can show off to your younger brother.</p>
<p>Richard Feynman explains it in his usual captivating way–</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I have a friend who's an artist … He'll hold up a flower and say "look how beautiful it is," and I'll agree. Then he says "I as an artist can see how beautiful this is but you as a scientist take this all apart and it becomes a dull thing," and I think that he's kind of nutty. First of all, the beauty that he sees is available to other people and to me too, I believe. Although I may not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is ... I can appreciate the beauty of a flower. At the same time, I see much more about the flower than he sees. I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions inside, which also have a beauty. I mean it's not just beauty at this dimension, at one centimeter; there's also beauty at smaller dimensions, the inner structure, also the processes. The fact that the colors in the flower evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting; it means that insects can see the color. It adds a question: does this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms? Why is it aesthetic? All kinds of interesting questions which the science knowledge only adds to the excitement, the mystery and the awe of a flower. It only adds. I don't understand how it subtracts.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The study of algorithms and the study of nature have things in common because they both connect with some underlying traits of the universe (order, chaos, structure, and creation). The algorithmist can dive a few layers deeper into the structure of the universe, never reaching a limit of fascinating nuance. While we borrow a lot from nature in writing software, the relationship works the other way around, as well.</p>
<p>The recursion of the flower reveals that coding is a rite; it summons the ineffable properties of the universe.</p>

      <a href="/posts/20131120-wbtbuddytechnical/">Implementing Interactive Engineering Calculations with Backbone Javascript</a>
      <span class="date">Nov 20</span>
    </h3>

    <p>I wrote lots of engineering reports as an undergrad in Mechanical Engineering, and I've always dreamed there was something more we could do more to present calculations to be understand, learned, and shared. Here is the result of a recent experiment to simplify a nasty Excel spreadsheet into an interactive calculation.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://smallredtile.com/stove/wbt-buddy/">WBT Buddy</a> is a single-page app that performs an energy efficiency calculation with the steps explicitly laid out. It also visualizes your result against some baseline quantities. </p>
<p>Everything happens in the browser. While the capability to do so has been around for a decade, it's never been easier to develop this sort of functionality thanks to a constellation of front-end tools: Backbone Javascript, CSS3, and Bootstrap.</p>
<p>The integration of these tools is quite painless. I built a sort of framework on top of them for the notion of a "user interface for engineering calculations". This is a big area, and this effort is certainly not the final say in how this should be done. Each problem will have its own contours, and you should choose your abstractions to fit into them.</p>
<p>With that in mind, here are some of the tools I chose and how they were deployed:</p>
<h2>Binding to Bootstrap events</h2>
<p>The fuel type selection box is a Bootstrap <code>.nav-pills</code> list. Each link item is given <code>data-toggle="pill"</code>. When the link is clicked a <code>shown.bs.tab</code> event is triggered. You can bind that event with one line of Backbone code:</p>
<p><img alt="navpills" src="/static/images/20131120navpills.png" /></p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
events: {
  'shown.bs.tab .fuel-type-choice' : 'updateOnClick'
}
</pre>

<h2>CSS bar-graph</h2>
<p>While I love the d3 visualization library, I was not looking forward to laying out an entire visualization for a single bar graph. Fortunately, I managed to pull this off with just CSS.</p>
<p>To render the bar corresponding to 15% here:</p>
<p><img alt="bargraph" src="/static/images/20131120-bar.png" /></p>
<p>This is all that's required:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;li class="yours"&gt;
  15%
  &lt;span class="bar" style="width:12%"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
</pre>

<p>Back when I was introduced to web programming as an intern in college, I spent an entire summer rendering bar graphs in Javascript. Now, it takes just a few minutes of choosing the right CSS property.</p>
<h2>numeral.js for formatting</h2>
<p>Formatting numbers isn't built-in to Javascript. I grabbed the numeral.js library to make this easy.</p>
<p>If I wanted to turn "26312.35266" into "26,312.35", I did this:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
return numeral(number).format("0,00.00");
</pre>

<h2>Domain Specific Language for updatable equations</h2>
<p>This feature will get its own blog post as it takes some explaining. Here is a short preview.</p>
<p>I implemented a tiny language for building templates for "steps of an equation". Here's what one of the equation steps looks like, with its two states shown:</p>
<p><img alt="equation1" src="/static/images/20131120-eq1.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="equation2" src="/static/images/20131120-eq2.png" /></p>
<p>The code that creates this equation step look like this:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
return model.equationTemplate(
  "E_H2O = ([m_H2O]) * [c_pH2O] * ([T_B] - [T_A])"
);
</pre>

<p>You can also do things like convert the variables to different units or format the output number. The following template converts the <code>E_H2O</code> quantity to kiloJoules and formats it with one digit after the decimal point.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
return model.equationTemplate(
  "OTE = [E_H2O kJ -f 0.0] / [E_fuel kJ -f 0.0]"
);
</pre>

<p>I originally fiddled with using a parser generator (PEG.js) for this feature. However, I found it was more straightforward to build on top of the underscore.js templating code (which in turn is built on top of John Resig's micro-templating example)</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Backbone.JS the implementation of the WBT Buddy quite enjoyable. Binding events between the inputs, equation model, and calculation outputs was logical. The abstractions in Backbone.JS are flexible. I never found myself fighting against the framework to get something done. I would reach for these tools again in future projects.</p>

<p>Which representation is more true to the story? More true emotionally? Which ones scare you more?</p>
<p>Choosing representations in user interfaces, data visualizations, and web design is a similar sort of question. Sometimes you want to move the user to action via emotion (in a sales pitch). Other times you want to appeal to cold hard reality (an analytics dashboard).</p>

    <p><img alt="Tablet" src="/static/images/20131104-rasmus.jpg" /></p>
<p>I got to see Rasmus Lerdorf talk a few years back. He left an impression as a pragmatic, no-nonsense problem solver. I ran into <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Rasmus_Lerdorf">some of his quotes</a> recently. </p>
<p>About relating to your tools:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PHP is about as exciting as your toothbrush. You use it every day, it does the job, it is a simple tool, so what? Who would want to read about toothbrushes?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Solutions should fit the problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ugly problems often require ugly solutions. Solving an ugly problem in a pure manner is bloody hard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don't forget that frameworks won't remove the fundamental challenge of problem solving in software development:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nothing is going to build your application for you, no matter what it promises. You are going to have to build it yourself. Instead of starting by fixing the mistakes in some foreign framework and refactoring all the things that don't apply to your environment spend your time building a lean and reusable pattern that fits your requirements directly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I actually hate programming, but I love solving problems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but don't take it on face value:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For all the folks getting excited about my quotes. Here is another - Yes, I am a terrible coder, but I am probably still better than you :)</p>

    <p><img alt="Tablet" src="/static/images/20131102-tablet.jpg" /></p>
<p>An ancient iPad?</p>
<p>Sort of. It's a diptych – a hinged device with two wax-coated plates used for temporary notes by scribes.</p>
<p>The really strange thing is that wax tablets were used for writing all the way until the 19th century (for fish markets in France, apparently).</p>
<p>It makes sense, what other writing surface has these traits:</p>
<ol>
<li>requires no electricity</li>
<li>wipes clean by hand</li>
<li>waterproof</li>
</ol>
<p>Modern electronics offer stunning capabilities, but can you imagine an iPad ever fulfilling all three of these design criteria? As advanced as our algorithms and electronics get, there's probably always going to be a situation that calls for a wax tablet.</p>
<p>While this is a bit of an exaggeration, it does illustrate that when you zoom out of the focus on consumer software and electronics, there are quite a stunning <em>variety</em> of demands of technological capabilities.</p>

      <span class="date">Nov 02</span>
    </h3>

    <p>Some fancy, very simple shortcuts that make a huge difference in text editing productivity.</p>
<p>You can use Emacs keybindings anywhere in OSX to do things like move the cursor to the end of the line, select a word, or start a new line of text.</p>
<p>I had a hard time finding these online, so I worked them out by trial and error:</p>
<pre>    
    Ctrl+D : Delete character
    Ctrl+K : Delete to end of line
    Ctrl+V : End of document
    Ctrl+W : Selects word
    Ctrl+O : Starts new line
    Ctrl+T : Transpose
    Ctrl+P : Previous Line
    Ctrl+N : Next Line
    Ctrl+F : Forward one character
    Ctrl+B : Backward one character
</pre>

<p>This works best is you map your Caps Lock to to the Ctrl key (it's in the System Preferences).</p>
<p>These keybindings keep me away from the arrow keys about 90% of the time, a big win for keyboard ergonomics.</p>

      <span class="date">Oct 29</span>
    </h3>

    <p>A few more days into my BackboneJS study, and I have been working through a bit of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Developing-Backbone-js-Applications-Addy-Osmani/dp/1449328253">Backbone Fundamentals book</a>. You can read it online for free on <a href="https://github.com/addyosmani/backbone-fundamentals">the author's Github</a>.</p>
<p>I did find myself stuck doing some yak shaving. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>yak shaving is what you are doing when you're doing some stupid, fiddly little task that bears no obvious relationship to what you're supposed to be working on, but yet a chain of twelve causal relations links what you're doing to the original meta-task. <a href="http://projects.csail.mit.edu/gsb/old-archive/gsb-archive/gsb2000-02-11.html">(source)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case, the yak was Mongodb, and shaving it involved debugging its broken installer on my recently updated Macbook. After a half hour of this, I gave up and ported the API in the exercise to use a tiny file-based data store called <a href="https://github.com/jtsage/nodejs-microdb">MicroDB</a>.</p>
<p>MicroDB was less than 200 lines of code, doesn't seem to have been updated in a year, and did exactly as much as I needed it to. It took about 10 minutes to port the code. </p>
<p>I uploaded the ported code to my Github accounts. There may be some sharp edges, but it implements all the major features (add, edit, delete) <a href="https://github.com/marcpare/backbone-fundamental-library-feweryaks">Github</a></p>
<p>I am quite curious now how you would go about building a NodeJS app with a file-based data store. This is a fantastically useful pattern for prototyping or smaller sites. I couldn't find any simple, convenient ways to do this. I'll be on the lookout. </p>

<p>The blue feathers in most birds don't actually have any blue pigment. The particular pattern of pores in the feather's structure scatter certain wavelengths of light so that it appears that they are colored.</p>
<p>In other words, it's a physical (structural) effect, not a chemical one. There isn't actually any blue in a kingfisher's feather.</p>
<p>The man that instigated the scientific investigation of this topic was ornithologist,
Louis Agassiz Fuertes. His bird observations are famous:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He made thousands of bird paintings and sketches, based on studies in nature and details from fresh specimens, that illustrate a range of ornithological works.</p>

<p>I learned a style tip about prototypal inheritance a few days ago from my study of BackboneJS, and I got to encounter the friendly folks behind TodoMVC.</p>
<p>I noticed a parameter that wasn't strictly necessary to the behavior of a function.</p>
<p>Here are the functions:</p>
<pre>
filterOne: function(todo){ todo.trigger('visible'); }
filterAll: function(){ app.todos.each(this.filterOne, this); }
</pre>

<p>Here is the change you can make to <code>filterAll</code> without breaking the behavior:</p>
<pre>
filterAll: function(){ app.todos.each(this.filterOne); }
</pre>

<p>I received a reply to my filed issue in less than a few hours. <a href="https://twitter.com/passy">@passy</a> let me know that, while not strictly necessary, passing in the extra <code>this</code> helps by keeping the current object around in case the <code>filterOne</code> function needs it in the future. </p>
<p>This sort of situation is not one that I have encountered in object-oriented programming, where you can't reassign the context of a function. In Javascript, this is really easy and, as I found out, something you encounter right away.</p>
<p>Do check out <a href="https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc">TodoMVC</a> if you're poking around modern Javascript frameworks. There is nothing like looking at real implementations. They responded to my issue filing right away, and I've learned a lot from their code so far.</p>

<p>How did Dr. Borlaug go about his work? He wasn't the typical stodgy scientist or reclusive nerd:</p>

    <p>John Siracusa's <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/10/os-x-10-9/18/">monster OS X upgrade review</a> just landed, and it doesn't disappoint.</p>
<p>The most important new change for me is battery life. Sounds boring, right?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And yet we all find big increases in battery life attractive, sometimes even revelatory, once we experience them. New MacBook Air owners have been giddily posting pictures of their battery status menu and explaining how it has changed their habits and, in some tiny way, their lives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For me, better battery life means better communication. </p>
<p>I may have a design meeting in the morning, coffee in the afternoon, then a work session in the evening. Inevitably, a chance meeting will happen in between.</p>
<p>Conversations tend to take place in places where it's hard to find a power source. Even if it isn't, searching for an adapter and tethering yourself to it reduces the spontaneity and smoothness of the encounter. If you don't have a reliable day's battery life, you'll be estimating constantly if it's worth taking out your computer for a demo.</p>
<p>How much of the success and failure of a software project is determined by the communication between client and developer? </p>
<p>I've found even just small improvements in communication have dramatic impacts on the joy and success of software projects. So, for me, better battery life translates to joy and success.</p>
<p>I hit upgrade right away.</p>

(from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_Dor%C3%A9">Wikipedia</a>)</p>
<p>Gustave Doré was the most popular illustrator of the the 1800s. He was extraordinarily prolific and commercially successful.</p>
<p>He fits the pattern of superhuman inborn talent finding just the right environment to flourish.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gustave Doré was born in Strasbourg in January 1832. He was the ultimate child prodigy. His earliest dated drawings were from the age of five...By the age of 12 he was carving his own lithographic stones, making sets of engravings with stories to go with them. </p>
<p>Doré exploded onto the Parisian art scene at the age of 15, even though he was short and looked about ten years old. The Doré family visited Paris for the first time when Gustave was 15...One day they went by a publishing company, with a set of engravings displayed in the window. Gustave immediately hatched a plan. </p>
<p>The next morning he feigned illness and told the family to go on without him. He quickly made several sketches and headed for that publishing company. He walked in the front door, found the office of the publisher Charles Philipon, and barged right in. He plopped his drawings down on Philipon's desk and exclaimed, "This is how that set of illustrations should be done." Philipon was amused at Gustave's antics, but when he looked down at the drawings he almost cried.</p>

      <span class="date">Oct 20</span>
    </h3>

    <p>Day 1 of studying backbonejs, and I found this gem in the source:</p>
<pre>
// A difficult-to-believe, but optimized internal dispatch function for
// triggering events. Tries to keep the usual cases speedy (most internal
// Backbone events have 3 arguments).
var triggerEvents = function(events, args) {
  var ev, i = -1, l = events.length, a1 = args[0], a2 = args[1], a3 = args[2];

  switch (args.length) {
    case 0: while (++i < l) (ev = events[i]).callback.call(ev.ctx); return;
    case 1: while (++i < l) (ev = events[i]).callback.call(ev.ctx, a1); return;
    case 2: while (++i < l) (ev = events[i]).callback.call(ev.ctx, a1, a2); return;
    case 3: while (++i < l) (ev = events[i]).callback.call(ev.ctx, a1, a2, a3); return;
    default: while (++i < l) (ev = events[i]).callback.apply(ev.ctx, args);
  }
};
</pre>

<p><code>(ev = events[i])</code> is a nifty trick to save a few characters (and make the code more clear).</p>
<p>Why does this function exist at all?</p>
<p>Looking carefully, it seems that the function attempts to use <code>call</code> rather than <code>apply</code>, only using <code>apply</code> as a last resort.</p>
<p>I think it's because <code>call</code> is faster than <code>apply</code>?</p>

<p>Cool stuff, shows just how much real-world Javascript performance is a dark art.</p>
