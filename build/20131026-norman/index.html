<p>Norman Ernest Borlaug was an American agronomist, humanitarian and Nobel laureate who has been called "The Man Who Saved A Billion Lives". (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug">wiki</a>)</p>
<p>How did Dr. Borlaug do about his work? He wasn't the typical stodgy scientist or reclusive nerd:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I needed to be a scrambling quarterback, to dart and weave and grab each chance that showed up in front of me. I couldn't know in advance what would appear, let alone how I'd respond.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He takes this idea further, connecting it to the role that he believes the scientist should play in societyâ€“</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The scientist is a privileged person, the man who should lead us out of the wilderness of static, unproductive agriculture, and yet by this apathy and failure to exercise his unique vision, he keeps us in the swamp of despair.</p>
<p><em>The scientist fears change because he is in a relatively privileged position in his own society.</em> If there is no breakthrough in yield, he will not be criticized. But if he makes a recommendation and something goes wrong, he may lose his job.</p>
</blockquote>

  <p>
    It's a reminder. The tiniest detail can make a huge difference. Society is the sum of contributions of many people. Small is beautiful.
