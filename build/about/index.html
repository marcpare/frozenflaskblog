  <h1>About</h1>
<p>A few notes on the mission and vision underlying <em>small red tile</em>.</p>
<p>In 2008, IBM flew me and the other top 300 collegiate algorithm programmers in the world to a secluded castle in Banff, Alberta to compete in the world finals of the ACM International Collegiate Programming Competition.</p>
<p>Before the contest, their top brass tried to convince us that we should be working on Digital Rights Management (DRM). The technical work sounded top-notch, but something felt very wrong, I couldn't justify applying expertise in the wonderful new digital world to artificially protecting a crusty, old, and dying industry.</p>
<p>This moment started a journey around the world, fueled by the big questions of software, networks, and people. I spent 2009 in France while building a digital narrative with natural language processing and data visualization to raise awareness of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, which Microsoft awarded a worldwide first prize in Cairo, Egypt. I could feel that I was on to something.</p>
<p>I travelled as far as rural Vietnam, spending two years designing and documenting clean energy technology with rural brick-makers, still noticing the echoes and influence of the digital world. People from dozens of countries engaged with my online content, leading to novel machine designs and enabling numerous projects in developing countries. Over 20,000 people in total have viewed my online documentation for a niche clean energy technology, my designs have been built on at least three continents, and I have been cited in a European PhD thesis.</p>
<p>This led me to Vashon Island, Seattle, a refuge for hippies and high tech, just a short ferry ride from downtown Seattle. After five years of generalist freelance work, I am focusing on some areas of interest: front-end, web, visualization, and data pipelines. Currently, I am working with startups and digital agencies to shape online storytelling.</p>
<p>If this work sounds interesting, please get in touch. I work primarily in Python, PHP, SQL, and Javascript these days.</p>

  <p>What's a <span id="tile"></span>?</p>
  <p>
    It's a reminder. The tiniest detail can make a huge difference. Society is the sum of contributions of many people. Small is beautiful.
