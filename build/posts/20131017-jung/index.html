    Carl Jung&#39;s Red Book
    <span class="date">Oct 15</span>
  </h3>

<p>I keep running into Jung: in Joseph Campbell's books, <em>The Magic Mountain</em>, and in Rockefeller's biography <em>Titan</em>. I didn't think much at first, but the more I learn, the more bizarre his life and work turns out to be.</p>
<p>The Red Book is one of his manuscripts, 205 pages long, filled with illustrations of his 'inner images':</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The years... when I pursued the inner images, were the most important time of my life. Everything else is to be derived from this. It began at that time, and the later details hardly matter anymore. My entire life consisted in elaborating what had burst forth from the unconscious and flooded me like an enigmatic stream and threatened to break me. That was the stuff and material for more than only one life. Everything later was merely the outer classification, scientific elaboration, and the integration into life. But the numinous beginning, which contained everything, was then.</p>

  <p>What's a <span id="tile"></span>?</p>
  <p>
    It's a reminder. The tiniest detail can make a huge difference. Society is the sum of contributions of many people. Small is beautiful.
