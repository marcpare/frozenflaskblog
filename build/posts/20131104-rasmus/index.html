    Say what you will about PHP, Rasmus Lerdorf is Awesome

<p>I got to see Rasmus Lerdorf talk a few years back. He left an impression as a pragmatic, no-nonsense problem solver. I ran into <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Rasmus_Lerdorf">some of his quotes</a> recently. </p>
<p>About relating to your tools:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PHP is about as exciting as your toothbrush. You use it every day, it does the job, it is a simple tool, so what? Who would want to read about toothbrushes?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Solutions should fit the problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ugly problems often require ugly solutions. Solving an ugly problem in a pure manner is bloody hard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don't forget that frameworks won't remove the fundamental challenge of problem solving in software development:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nothing is going to build your application for you, no matter what it promises. You are going to have to build it yourself. Instead of starting by fixing the mistakes in some foreign framework and refactoring all the things that don't apply to your environment spend your time building a lean and reusable pattern that fits your requirements directly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I actually hate programming, but I love solving problems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but don't take it on face value:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For all the folks getting excited about my quotes. Here is another - Yes, I am a terrible coder, but I am probably still better than you :)</p>
</blockquote>

    It's a reminder that in the mosaic of society, the tiniest detail can change everything, that progress is the sum of contributions of many people, and that small is beautiful.
