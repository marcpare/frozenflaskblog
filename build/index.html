<h2>User Interface Design &amp; Prototyping</h2>

<div class="letter">

   <p>Providing a modern approach to UI design and development, using hand-crafted techniques for rapid development of interactive prototypes of web applications.</p>

    <p>Instead of imagining how your web application will work, see it in action—quickly—and at a reasonable cost.</p>

   <p>by Marc Paré: generalist software developer with intuition for user experience, handiness at copy-writing, and eye for clean design.</p>

  <h3>Major accomplishments</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>designed and built a web software product prototype that raised a $500k angel investment</li>
    <li>conceived and built an online digital narrative that won Microsoft's Imagine Cup against thousands of international competitors</li>
    <li>built a prototype interactive training course for the World Bank's IFC, to be piloted across Southeast Asia</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Process and Approach</h3>

  <p>Why are so many web user interfaces over-complicated and ineffective? And why do they still cost so much to build?</p>

  <p>Modern web browsers have enabled sophisticated user interfaces. Unfortunately, traditional approaches to UI design, such as static mockups in Photoshop, fail to capture the essential parts of modern interface design: interaction, animation, and responsiveness to screen-size.</p>

  <p>Cost escalates because of the interaction of graphic designers and software engineers. Graphic designers without software background fail to consider fundamental implementation problems. Software engineers are trained to move slowly and carefully, rather than quickly through the space of product possibilities. Passing a UI design problem between these two competing sides blows up costs.</p>

  <h3>What can be done?</h3>

  <p>Product prototypes in HTML and Javascript accurately capture the end user experience. Piping in real application data reveals its contours and character, avoiding surprises down the line when the Photoshop mockups turns out to be impossible to implement.</p>

  <p>It is much easier to plan and manage the development of a product that has been prototyped at high fidelity. This, of course, greatly reduces cost and mitigates execution risk.</p>

  <h3>A Unique Background</h3>

  <p>I trained in competitive algorithm programming (World Finalist in the 2008 ACM ICPC), which gives me insight into the back-end functionality of web apps as well as very sharp coding skills under time pressure. I have no trouble interfacing with experts in machine learning, algorithms, or databases.</p>

  <p>I have been building front-ends and web applications for startups, research labs, and large institutions for the last five years.</p>

  <p>What's a <em>small red tile</em>?</p>

    It's a reminder that in the mosaic of society, the tiniest detail can change everything, that progress is the sum of contributions of many people, and that small is beautiful.
