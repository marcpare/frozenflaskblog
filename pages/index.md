<h2>software development for web ventures</h2>

<div class="letter">
    
   <p>I am a generalist developer with an emphasis on the web.</p>

   <p>Commonly, I work with startup founders and CEOs to translate product vision into working software.</p>
   
   <p>I work primarily in Javascript and Python.</p>
  
  <h3>Major accomplishments</h3>
  
  <ul>
    <li>designed and built a web product prototype responsible for a major angel investment (a 10x ROI on services)</li>
    <li>conceived and built an online digital narrative that won Microsoft's Imagine Cup against thousands of international competitors</li>
    <li>built a prototype interactive online training course for the World Bank's IFC, to be piloted across Southeast Asia</li>
    <li>found dozens of defects in a nuclear reactor specification with custom document analysis software</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Further details about each of these projects (and more) can be found on my <a href="/portfolio">portfolio</a> page.</p>  
  
  <h3>A Unique Background</h3>
  
  <p>I have been building front-ends and web applications for startups, research labs, and large institutions for the last five years.</p>
  
  <p>Before that, I trained in competitive algorithm programming (World Finalist in the 2008 ACM ICPC), which gives me insight into the back-end functionality of web apps as well as very sharp coding skills under time pressure.</p>
  
  <p>The nuclear reactor story is not an exaggeration, by the way: I parsed hundreds of pages of Word and Excel documents for the French nuclear power company AREVA in 2009 in order to find inconsistencies between versions of reactor control room specifications. There were dozens.</p>
