<h2>User Interface Design &amp; Prototyping</h2><div class="letter">
    
   <p>Providing a modern approach to UI design and development, using hand-crafted techniques for rapid development of interactive prototypes of web applications.</p>
   
    <p>Instead of imagining how your web application will work, see it in action—quickly—and at a reasonable cost.</p>
   
   <p>by Marc Paré: generalist software developer with intuition for user experience, handiness at copy-writing, and eye for clean design.</p>
  
  <h3>Major accomplishments</h3>
  
  <ul>
    <li>designed and built a web software product prototype that raised a $500k angel investment</li>
    <li>conceived and built an online digital narrative that won Microsoft's Imagine Cup against thousands of international competitors</li>
    <li>built a prototype interactive training course for the World Bank's IFC, to be piloted across Southeast Asia</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Process and Approach</h3>
  
  <p>It is much easier to plan and manage the development of a product that has been prototyped at high fidelity. Rapid product prototypes in HTML and Javascript accurately capture end user experience and reveal the contours and dynamics of real application data. This greatly reduces overall project cost and execution risk.</p>  
  
  <h3>A Unique Background</h3>
  
  <p>I trained in competitive algorithm programming (World Finalist in the 2008 ACM ICPC), which gives me insight into the back-end functionality of web apps as well as very sharp coding skills under time pressure. I have no trouble interfacing with experts in machine learning, algorithms, or databases.</p>
  
  <p>I have been building front-ends and web applications for startups, research labs, and large institutions for the last five years.</p>
