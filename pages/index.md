  <p>Hi, I'm Marc Par&eacute; and I design and write software&mdash;digital artifacts that delight and amuse as well as solid components that move the needle on business goals.</p>

  <p>For example, I have</p>
     
  <ul>
    <li>designed and built a web software product prototype that raised a $500k angel investment</li>
    <li>conceived and built an interactive digital narrative that won Microsoft's Imagine Cup against thousands of international competitors</li>
    <li>published online documentation of clean energy technology that has reached over 20,000 people and been cited in a PhD thesis.</li>
  </ul>
    
  <p>If this sounds interesting, please <a href="contact.html">get in touch</a>. I work primarily in Python, PHP, SQL, and Javascript these days.</p>
    
   <p>Some of my favorite images from my work:</p>
