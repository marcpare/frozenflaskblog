Work
==========

I am a generalist developer comfortable getting up to speed on tech stacks in surprisingly little time.

I think I bring an out of the ordinary amount of creativity to technical work. One of my algorithm programming teammates, a former Microsoft engineer, had this to say:

> Marc is an especially creative individual who is able to take a problem and deconstruct it in unique ways. This was helpful during my time with Marc on the Georgia Tech programming team, as he was able to come up with creative new algorithms for problems, on demand.

Some past projects include

* Researching and testing NoSQL alternatives for a scale-challenged web startup
* Designing and building a social network from scratch to launch
* Automating processing of Microsoft Word documents (100s of pages)
