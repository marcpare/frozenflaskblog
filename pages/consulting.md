* Building an API to query CAD model information over HTTP
* Building a demonstration web application for a startup
* Processing 100s of JSON files into a structured format for a web application
* Building a data analysis pipeline to accelerate simulations in a research lab
* Implementing a domain specific language (DSL) for a mathematical programming language

The full list of companies and groups that I have written code for:
