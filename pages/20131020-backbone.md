Day 1 of studying backbonejs, and I found this interesting gem in the source:

<pre>
// A difficult-to-believe, but optimized internal dispatch function for
// triggering events. Tries to keep the usual cases speedy (most internal
// Backbone events have 3 arguments).
var triggerEvents = function(events, args) {
  var ev, i = -1, l = events.length, a1 = args[0], a2 = args[1], a3 = args[2];
  
  switch (args.length) {
    case 0: while (++i < l) (ev = events[i]).callback.call(ev.ctx); return;
    case 1: while (++i < l) (ev = events[i]).callback.call(ev.ctx, a1); return;
    case 2: while (++i < l) (ev = events[i]).callback.call(ev.ctx, a1, a2); return;
    case 3: while (++i < l) (ev = events[i]).callback.call(ev.ctx, a1, a2, a3); return;
    default: while (++i < l) (ev = events[i]).callback.apply(ev.ctx, args);
  }
};
</pre>

`(ev = events[i])` is a nifty trick to save a few characters (and make the code more clear).

The thing I wondered was why does this function exist at all?

Looking carefully, it seems that the function attempts to use `call` rather than `apply`, only using `apply` as a last resort.

I think it's because call is faster than apply?
