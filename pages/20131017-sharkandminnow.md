The latest piece in digital narrative from the creative desks at the NY Times about "the world's most surreal fishing camp." [A Game of Shark and Minnow](http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2013/10/27/south-china-sea/?hp)

Lots of gems in this story: politics, Asia, geography, history, fishing, technology, economics, and more. The screen clip above is from a section that describes the ingenuity of people on the marooned boat.

The notes on geo-political strategy use cabbage, salami, big bellies, and forest growth as metaphors.

The source code isn't minified or obfuscated in case you're curious about how this sort of visualization gets built.
