I learned a style tip about prototypal inheritance a few days ago from my study of BackboneJS, and I got to encounter the friendly folks behind TodoMVC.

I noticed a parameter that wasn't strictly necessary to the behavior of a function.

Here are the functions:

<pre>
filterOne: function(todo){ todo.trigger('visible'); }
filterAll: function(){ app.todos.each(this.filterOne, this); }
</pre>

Here is the change you can make to `filterAll` without breaking the behavior:

<pre>
filterAll: function(){ app.todos.each(this.filterOne); }
</pre>

I received a reply to my filed issue in less than a few hours. [@passy](https://twitter.com/passy) let me know that, while not strictly necessary, passing in the extra `this` helps by keeping the current object around in case the `filterOne` function needs it in the future. 

This sort of situation is not one that I have encountered in object-oriented programming, where you can't reassign the context of a function. In Javascript, this is really easy and, as I found out, something you encounter right away.

Do check out [TodoMVC](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc) if you're poking around modern Javascript frameworks. There is nothing like looking at real implementations. They responded to my issue filing right away, and I've learned a lot from their code so far.
