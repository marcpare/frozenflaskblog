Perhaps you've also run into TypeErrors when accessing deeply nested properties in Javascript objects?

If not, consider a nested object like,

<pre class="prettyprint">
obj = {
  event: {
    location: {
      place: {
        name: 'Friday Harbor'
      }
    }
  }
}
</pre>

Access the nested `name` in the naive way looks like this:

<pre class="prettyprint">
obj.event.location.place.name
</pre>

Unfortunately, we get a TypeError if any of the fields are `null` or `undefined`.

There are two basic techniques for dealing with this:

1. Check for existence at each level of property access
2. Wrap property access in a `try/catch` block

Neither technique results in particularly nice code. You don't want to be wrapping every object access in a `try/catch` block, nor do you want to be writing pyramids of `if` statements.

There's another little bit to consider: what do you do if your lookup fails? I usually want to just return some default value. 

After a bit of searching, I found a few main approaches to do object traversal nicely. I found each lacking.

(1) "Path" lookups

A path lookup looks like some variation of the following,

<pre class="prettyprint">
obj.path('event.location.place.name');
// returns undefined if fails
</pre>

This works ok unless you have a property with a `.` in it. One implementation ([SteelToe](https://github.com/jclem/steeltoe)) could handle this:

<pre class="prettyprint">
SteelToe(obj)('event')('location')('place')('name')
</pre>

But the bigger issue is that it forces us to use a new API for object traversal. Introducing new APIs for fundamental operations has to be done carefully, and I think this path lookups don't quite strike the balance.

(2) [cheap monads](http://blog.osteele.com/posts/2007/12/cheap-monads)

A sort of variation on existence checking.

<pre class="prettyprint">
var name = 
  ((((obj||{}).event||{}).location||{}).place||{}).name;
</pre>

Lots of syntactic noise. Requires funky paren balancing. A good technique if you want to impress someone reading your code but not the clearest.

(3) [Monad.js](https://github.com/chrislewis/monad.js)

An interesting attempt to create an `either` construct that we can use to wrap the unsafe traversal operation. Unfortunately, getting our value out of the monad isn't so pretty.

<pre class="prettyprint">
var unsafe_name = function () { 
  return obj.event.location.place.name; 
}
var safe_name = monad.eitherEx(unsafe_name);

var name = safe_name.fold(
  function (error) {
    return 'some default value';
  },
  function (name) {
    return name;
  }
);
</pre>

While option (3), Monad.js, looks like the worst of the three, it got me thinking along an interesting line. The heart of the pattern is wrapping an unsafe operation in a function. Let's try a variation on this idea.

The Towel
---

Let's say that I just want to soak up the error after a failed function call and return some default value. Well, that isn't too hard to do:
  
<pre class="prettyprint">
// a towel soaks errors
function towel = function (f, default) {
  try {
    return f();
  } catch (e) {
    return default;
  }
}
</pre>

If `f()` produces an error, the function returns the provided default value. Otherwise, it just returns `f()`.
  
We can make it a bit more capable by optionally calling `default` if it happens to be a function:

<pre class="prettyprint">  
function towel = function (f, default) {
  try {
    return f();
  } catch (e) {
    return _.result(default);
  }
}
</pre>

([`_.result`](http://underscorejs.org/#result))

Now safely traversing an object is easy. We just wrap our dangerous traversal in a function and soak up any error it might produce:

<pre class="prettyprint"> 
var getName = function () { 
  return obj.event.location.place.name; 
}
var name = towel(getName, 'not found');
</pre>

We use the familiar old object dot notation to access our property. We don't introduce any obscure syntax, relying instead on tried and true Javascript functions. This has a nice bonus because as Javascript evolves, the little bit of syntactic noise we incur will disappear. Here's an implementation using the ES6 "fat arrow" syntax:

<pre class="prettyprint"> 
var name = 
  towel(() => obj.event.location.place.name, 'not found');
</pre>
