An ancient iPad?

Sort of. It's a diptych â€“ a hinged device with two wax-coated plates used for temporary notes by scribes.

The really strange thing is that wax tablets were used for writing all the way until the 19th century (for fish markets in France, apparently).

It makes sense, what other writing surface has these traits:

1. requires no electricity
2. wipes clean by hand
3. waterproof

Modern electronics offer stunning capabilities, but can you imagine an iPad ever fulfilling all three of these design criteria? As advanced as our algorithms and electronics get, there's probably always going to be a situation that calls for a wax tablet.

While this is a bit of an exaggeration, it does illustrate that when you zoom out of the focus on consumer software and electronics, there are quite a stunning _variety_ of demands of technological capabilities.
