Gustave Doré was the most popular illustrator of the the 1800s. He was extraordinarily prolific and commercially successful.

He fits the pattern of superhuman inborn talent finding just the right environment to flourish.

> Gustave Doré was born in Strasbourg in January 1832. He was the ultimate child prodigy. His earliest dated drawings were from the age of five...By the age of 12 he was carving his own lithographic stones, making sets of engravings with stories to go with them. 

> Doré exploded onto the Parisian art scene at the age of 15, even though he was short and looked about ten years old. The Doré family visited Paris for the first time when Gustave was 15...One day they went by a publishing company, with a set of engravings displayed in the window. Gustave immediately hatched a plan. 

>The next morning he feigned illness and told the family to go on without him. He quickly made several sketches and headed for that publishing company. He walked in the front door, found the office of the publisher Charles Philipon, and barged right in. He plopped his drawings down on Philipon's desk and exclaimed, "This is how that set of illustrations should be done." Philipon was amused at Gustave's antics, but when he looked down at the drawings he almost cried.

I love stories like this for a good dose of ego-check.
