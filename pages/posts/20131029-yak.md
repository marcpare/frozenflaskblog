A few more days into my BackboneJS study, and I have been working through a bit of the [Backbone Fundamentals book](http://www.amazon.com/Developing-Backbone-js-Applications-Addy-Osmani/dp/1449328253). You can read it online for free on [the author's Github](https://github.com/addyosmani/backbone-fundamentals).

I did find myself stuck doing some yak shaving. 

> yak shaving is what you are doing when you're doing some stupid, fiddly little task that bears no obvious relationship to what you're supposed to be working on, but yet a chain of twelve causal relations links what you're doing to the original meta-task. [(source)](http://projects.csail.mit.edu/gsb/old-archive/gsb-archive/gsb2000-02-11.html)

In this case, the yak was Mongodb, and shaving it involved debugging its broken installer on my recently updated Macbook. After a half hour of this, I gave up and ported the API in the exercise to use a tiny file-based data store called [MicroDB](https://github.com/jtsage/nodejs-microdb).

MicroDB was less than 200 lines of code, doesn't seem to have been updated in a year, and did exactly as much as I needed it to. It took about 10 minutes to port the code. 

I uploaded the ported code to my Github accounts. There may be some sharp edges, but it implements all the major features (add, edit, delete) [Github](https://github.com/marcpare/backbone-fundamental-library-feweryaks)

I am quite curious now how you would go about building a NodeJS app with a file-based data store. This is a fantastically useful pattern for prototyping or smaller sites. I couldn't find any simple, convenient ways to do this. I'll be on the lookout. EDIT (2014-06-02): Found one: https://github.com/moserrya/knod
