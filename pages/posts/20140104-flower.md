Worms, trees, branches, roots, seeds, genetic algorithms, viruses. Why do we borrow so many metaphors in computing from nature?

These interesting white clusters grow around our place on Vashon Island. They’re called Queen Anne's Lace. They range in size from 1 cm across to about 10 cm. The smaller ones have just a half dozen little buds of flowers. The largest ones are a dense disk of flowers within flowers. I was trying to sort out the pattern of the petals while waiting for the bus one afternoon.

If you look closely, you see that the whole thing is made up of really tiny flowers. These tiny flowers form clumps, which are arranged in growing rings from the center of flower. I tried to count how many flowers were in each clump, but it wasn't all that easy to tell.

Eventually, I decided there were five clumps in each ring. But there were actually two rings at each level, so it's more like there are ten clumps in each ring. I decided that each clump follows the same rules as the overall pattern. Each time a ring emanates one step further from the center of the flower, each clump grows another ring. I used this algorithm to generate a picture of the flower.

It's a recursive algorithm: the pattern of each small cluster of flowers is the same pattern as the arrangement of all the clusters. There's all sorts of clever patterns in the plants, animals, and weather around which keep things from falling apart in the face of astonishing complexity. An intuition about these sorts of patterns will help you write better software since writing software is essentially the act of managing complexity. 

So, looking at nature might be good for your programming practice. But this exercise was interesting in sort of the other direction as well: analyzing the algorithm for generating the flower taught me something about nature. It’s satisfying to see that there is some pattern to how the flower is organized. It’s more fun later when you look at another flower and realize a subtle difference in the pattern. This process transforms nature from “that green stuff all around” into an unending collection of delightful things: a specific herb that you can crush up and use to stop bleeding, a marker of the health of the air and soil, a little toy you can show off to your younger brother.

Richard Feynman explains it in his usual captivating way–

> “I have a friend who's an artist … He'll hold up a flower and say "look how beautiful it is," and I'll agree. Then he says "I as an artist can see how beautiful this is but you as a scientist take this all apart and it becomes a dull thing," and I think that he's kind of nutty. First of all, the beauty that he sees is available to other people and to me too, I believe. Although I may not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is ... I can appreciate the beauty of a flower. At the same time, I see much more about the flower than he sees. I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions inside, which also have a beauty. I mean it's not just beauty at this dimension, at one centimeter; there's also beauty at smaller dimensions, the inner structure, also the processes. The fact that the colors in the flower evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting; it means that insects can see the color. It adds a question: does this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms? Why is it aesthetic? All kinds of interesting questions which the science knowledge only adds to the excitement, the mystery and the awe of a flower. It only adds. I don't understand how it subtracts.”

The study of algorithms and the study of nature have things in common because they both connect with some underlying traits of the universe (order, chaos, structure, and creation). The algorithmist can dive a few layers deeper into the structure of the universe, never reaching a limit of fascinating nuance. While we borrow a lot from nature in writing software, the relationship works the other way around, as well.

The recursion of the flower reveals that coding is a rite; it summons the ineffable properties of the universe.
