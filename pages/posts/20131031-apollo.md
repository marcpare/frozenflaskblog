A [bunch of documentation](http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/main.html) from the Apollo space mission, "arguably the most difficult technological undertaking in all of history."

I am amazed how little documentation the engineers that sent a man to the moon produced. They didn't have the possibility of copy+paste, so they had to choose their words carefully and prepare information-rich diagrams.

You can take this reasoning pretty far: Edward Tufte argues convincingly that the advent of [Powerpoint _reduced_ the quality of engineering work](http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001yB) at NASA.
