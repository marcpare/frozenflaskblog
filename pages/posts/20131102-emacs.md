Some fancy, very simple shortcuts that make a huge difference in text editing productivity.

You can use Emacs keybindings anywhere in OSX to do things like move the cursor to the end of the line, select a word, or start a new line of text.

I had a hard time finding these online, so I worked them out by trial and error:

<pre>    
    Ctrl+D : Delete character
    Ctrl+K : Delete to end of line
    Ctrl+V : End of document
    Ctrl+W : Selects word
    Ctrl+O : Starts new line
    Ctrl+T : Transpose
    Ctrl+P : Previous Line
    Ctrl+N : Next Line
    Ctrl+F : Forward one character
    Ctrl+B : Backward one character
</pre>

This works best is you map your Caps Lock to to the Ctrl key (it's in the System Preferences).

These keybindings keep me away from the arrow keys about 90% of the time, a big win for keyboard ergonomics.
