The blue feathers in most birds don't actually have any blue pigment. The particular pattern of pores in the feather's structure scatter certain wavelengths of light so that it appears that they are colored.

In other words, it's a physical (structural) effect, not a chemical one. There isn't actually any blue in a kingfisher's feather.

The man that instigated the scientific investigation of this topic was ornithologist,
Louis Agassiz Fuertes. His bird observations are famous:

> He made thousands of bird paintings and sketches, based on studies in nature and details from fresh specimens, that illustrate a range of ornithological works.

As the sketches above show, he could draw complex bird behavior from memory.

Awesome to consider how sharply Agassiz managed to hone his skills of observation.
